# community-scripts

Scripts created by the autobrr community to be used as **External Filter** or **Action**.

## Add new

Open a PR with your script added in a new directory in `scripts` and add a `README.md` with some basic instructions on what the script does and how to use it. You can copy and paste from `scripts/freespace-generic`.

## License

All scripts are under MIT license so you can edit and modify as you please. We do however welcome new variants.
